#  - 	Subtraction 	x - y 	
#  * 	Multiplication 	x * y 	
#  / 	Division 	x / y 	
#  % 	Modulus 	x % y 	
#  ** 	Exponentiation 	x ** y 	
#  // 	Floor division 	x // y

# Assignment operators
#  = 	 x = 5 	 x = 5 	
#  += 	 x += 3 	x = x + 3 	
#  -= 	 x -= 3 	x = x - 3 	
#  *= 	 x *= 3 	x = x * 3 	
#  /= 	 x /= 3 	x = x / 3 	
#  %= 	 x %= 3 	x = x % 3 	
#  //= 	 x //= 3 	x = x // 3 	
#  **= 	 x **= 3 	x = x ** 3 	
#  &= 	 x &= 3 	x = x & 3 	
#  |= 	 x |= 3 	x = x | 3 	
#  ^= 	 x ^= 3 	x = x ^ 3 	
#  >>= 	 x >>= 3 	x = x >> 3
